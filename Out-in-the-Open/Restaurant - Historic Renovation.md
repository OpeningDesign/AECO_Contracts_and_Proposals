## Fee & Workflow Proposal		

Over the years, OpeningDesign has developed a preferred and unique way of working.  Although our website's [about page](http://openingdesign.com/about/) provides more detail, in a nutshell, most of our projects are [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and are conducted [out-in-the-open](http://openingdesign.com/about/).

Simply put, this way of working allows us to be more efficient, ultimately keeping costs down and bringing more value to our clients.  Having said that, we understand some clients, for whatever reason, may have hesitations regarding this approach.

To address _____'s potential concerns, if any, we would like to offer the following (3) workflow and fee options:

 * **Approach (A): A Fully Open Approach** where the construction documentation, location, and the names of the parties involved in this contract are known and are shared publicly.  All newly created digital documentation/content is [open source](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), that is, will be freely available to any party for future use, assuming the terms such as [Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) and [ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) are honored.
 * **Approach (B): An Anonymous Open Approach** where all newly created documentation is shared publicly, however, the location and the names of the parties involved are kept anonymous.   Again, similar to approach (A), all newly created digital documentation/content is [open source](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
 * **Approach &#40;C): The Traditional Approach** where all documentation and parties involved remain confidential and private.

> - Please note, no matter which approach (A, B, or C) is used above...
> 	-  Any documentation from parties outside this contract, and/or shared with OpeningDesign **prior** to the signing of this contract, **WILL NOT** be shared publicly.
> 	- Any prior emails, or any emails between _____, OpeningDesign, or any other parties during the duration of the project, **WILL NOT** be shared publicly.
> 	- Also, we will not make public anything that _____ explicitly indicates should be kept private.

### Part 1: Fee Proposal

As is typical with the initial phases of a building project, the design is often too nebulous to determine a realistic ‘lump-sum’ and/or not-to-exceed maximum fee.  In that light, we propose a two part fee contract whereby the first part will be a an hourly rate proposal for approximately a fifth (1/5th) of the project’s schedule--that is, the early 1)Programming and 2)Schematic Design Phases of the project.  

For the second part, when the extent of the scope is better defined, we propose to continue with our hourly fees, but amend the contract ***(Part 2, below)*** by adding a not-to-exceed maximum fee.  This fee will be a fixed percentage of final construction costs.



### Part 2: Not-to-Exceed Fee Proposal Options (**A**, **B**, or **C**):

```Please note, the not-to-exceed fees below were established at the end of the 1) Programming and 2) Schematic Phases.```

|-|Approach (A)|Approach (B)|Approach &#40;C)|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Total Not-to-exceed Fee** <br>(X% of construction costs)| 9%|11.5%|13%|
|Assuming estimated construction <br>costs of **$2,000,000**|$180,000|$230,000|$260,000|




> *Please note, these are not **lump sum** fees, but are instead, **not-to-exceed** fees.  If the project costs go down/up, or less/more scope is involved over time, these fee ceilings will adjust relatively. 
> 
> The **Hourly Rates**called out below (which are well below what we see currently in the market), will apply until this not-to-exceed fee is reached.
>
>By using hourly rates and a not-to-exceed fees based on percentages of construction, we have found this to be a win-win for both parties.  The design professionals are given a little more safeguard against potential [scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep) and the client can realize more economical fees if they are able to make decisions quicker and more consistently--moving the design of the project along quicker.

### The Determination of the Not-to-Exceed Fee

For _____'s reference and peace of mind, please review the following document as to what the standard practices are for establishing design fees in the construction/architecture industry.

[A Guide to Determining Appropriate Fees  for the Services of an Architect Consultants](http://www.mbarchitects.org/docs/guide_architectservicefees%28e%29.pdf).

In referencing **page 12**, under the following list of assumptions, they suggest an average range for design services to be around **11.40%** of construction costs.

 - Building Category = **5**
	 - *(Restaurant, Licensed Beverage Establishment from **Page 30**)*
 - Complexity Level = **Average**
 - Construction Costs = **$2M to < $5M**
 - with Basic Engineering (structural, mechanical and electrical ONLY)

Additionally, per section ***1.2 (Fee Adjustment Factors / Variables affecting the Architect’s Fee)*** they suggest adjusting the fee based on a list of unique factors **(page 13)**.  Of those listed there, the following **Factor 1.2.11** is pertinent to your proposed project.

---

- ***1.2.11  Fee Adjustment Factor 11***
	- ***Renovation to existing Buildings (versus New Construction)***
		- *Renovation work is well-known for its unknown conditions. This is the reason that it is recommended that renovations to existing buildings be performed on a time basis. If a percentage-fee is used the fee needs to be adjusted and increased to allow for the unknown work   and  the  subsequent design    modifications the  Architects will   need   to  make.    Some provincial associations recommend an adjustment of an additional two-thirds of the fee or an adjustment factor of 1.65 for renovations*

---

If one applied an adjustment factor of 1.65, as suggested above, the adjusted fee would be **18.81%** (1.65 x 11.40%) of construction costs.

Obviously this is a pretty hefty fee.

 As you can see from our proposed not-to-exceed fee and hourly rates outlined above, not to mention our eagerness to work with you, we have decided to provide a more economical rate relative what the industry average suggests.  

We are confident that through our unique and open way of working and our strong band of consultants, that that we will meet and exceed the industry standard of care.

#### Reimbursable expenses include:

* Transportation in connection with the project for travel authorized by the client (transportation, lodging and meals)
* Communication and shipping costs (long distance charges, courier, postage, dedicated web hosting, etc.)
* Reproduction costs for plans, sketches, drawings, graphic representations and other documents
* Renderings, models, prints of computer-generated drawings, mock-ups specifically	requested	 by the client

* Additional insurance coverage or limits, including additional professional liability insurance requested by the client in a excess of that normally carried by the architect and the architect’s consultants
* Direct expenses from additional consultants not specifically outlined in this proposal

*Reimbursable expenses include an additional 10% to cover in-house administration,	handling,	and	financing.*
