#### Proposal for [OpeningDesign's](http://openingdesign.com/) Architecture & Engineering Services

---
Thank you for the opportunity to submit our proposal for the lobby renovation of  -------- We are excited about the project and the potential of working together.

Although a more nuanced list of requirements will undoubtedly unfold as the project evolves, on a high-level, we understand that the project will include the following...

 - Incorporate a new elevator that spans the 3 floors in and around the existing lobby area.
	 - Priority given to locating elevator in an area to increase or maximize rentable square footage 
 - Newly updated, ADA complaint restrooms on all 3 floors
 - Throughout the 3 floors, newly updated finishes in and around the lobby and public corridors

As we understand it, the following will not be included in this proposal scope.

- Inside the tenant suites, other than the adjoining walls (potentially) near the newly renovated elevator/lobby/restroom areas.
- Any exterior work

## Fee & Workflow Proposal		

Over the years, OpeningDesign has developed a preferred and unique way of working.  Although our website's [about page](http://openingdesign.com/about/) provides more detail, in a nutshell, most of our projects are [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and are conducted [out-in-the-open](http://openingdesign.com/about/).

Simply put, this way of working allows us to be more efficient, ultimately keeping costs down and bringing more value to our clients.  Having said that, we understand some clients, for whatever reason, may have hesitations regarding this approach.

To address _____s potential concerns, if any, we would like to offer the following (3) workflow and fee options:

 * **Approach (A): A Fully Open Approach** where the construction documentation, location, and the names of the parties involved in this contract are known and are shared publicly.  All newly created digital documentation/content is [open source](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), that is, will be freely available to any party for future use, assuming the terms such as [Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) and [ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) are honored.
 * **Approach (B): An Anonymous Open Approach** where all newly created documentation is shared publicly, however, the location and the names of the parties involved are kept anonymous.   Again, similar to approach (A), all newly created digital documentation/content is [open source](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
 * **Approach &#40;C): The Traditional Approach** where all documentation and parties involved remain confidential and private.

> - Please note, no matter which approach (A, B, or C) is used above...
> 	-  Any documentation from parties outside this contract, and/or shared with OpeningDesign **prior** to the signing of this contract, **WILL NOT** be shared publicly.
> 	- Any prior emails, or any emails between MCRED, OpeningDesign, or any other parties during the duration of the project, **WILL NOT** be shared publicly.
> 	- Also, we will not make public anything that MCRED explicitly indicates should be kept private.

<br>

### Not-to-Exceed Fee Proposal Options (**A**, **B**, or **C**):



|-|Approach (A)|Approach (B)|Approach &#40;C)|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Total Not-to-exceed Fee** <br>(X% of construction costs)| 9%|10.5%|12%|
|Rough estimate of  construction <br>costs of **$150,000**|$13,500|$15,750|$18,000|


> *Please note, these are not **lump sum** fees, but are instead, **not-to-exceed** fees.  If the project costs go down/up, or less/more scope is involved over time, these fee ceilings will adjust relatively. 
> 
> The **Hourly Rates**, called out below, will apply until this not-to-exceed fee is reached.

### Hourly Rates

---

|-|Approach (A)|Approach (B)|Approach (C)|A Rough<br>Estimated<br>Percentage<br> of Fees
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** <br> [OpeningDesign](http://openingdesign.com)|
|Level 1 |$70/HR|$80/HR|$100/HR|70%|
|Level 2 | $55/HR|$65/HR|$75/HR|26%|
| **Structural Engineer Consultant** <br> [Ntrive](http://ntrive.com/)| 
|Level 1 |$170/HR|$170/HR|$170/HR|1%|
|Level 3 |$125/HR|$125/HR|$125/HR|1%|
|Level 4 |$100/HR|$100/HR|$100/HR|1%|
|Level 6 |$85/HR|$85/HR|$85/HR|1%|
||||||
|**TOTAL**||||100%|


Additionally, the following list of consultants may be required during this project.  Their associated billing rates would be accounted for in the overall not-to-exceed A/E fee.

* Specification Writer
* Door Hardware Consultant
* Lighting Consultant
* Elevator Consultant

*Consultant expenses will include an **additional 10%** to cover in-house administration, handling, financing, and insurance costs.*

### The Determination of the Not-to-Exceed Fee

For _____s reference and peace of mind, please review the following document as to what the standard practices are for establishing design fees in the construction/architecture industry.

[A Guide to Determining Appropriate Fees  for the Services of an Architect Consultants](http://www.mbarchitects.org/docs/guide_architectservicefees%28e%29.pdf).

In referencing **page 11**, under the following list of assumptions, they suggest an average range for design services to be around **8.3%** of construction costs.

 - Building Category = **3**
	 - *(3.6 Commercial or Administrative Office Building from **Page 30**)*
 - Complexity Level = **Average**
 - Construction Costs = **< $5M**
 - WITHOUT Basic Engineering Fees

Additionally, per section ***1.2 (Fee Adjustment Factors / Variables affecting the Architect’s Fee)*** they suggest adjusting the fee based on a list of unique factors **(page 13)**.  Of those listed there, the following **Factor 1.2.11** is pertinent to your proposed project.

---

- ***1.2.11  Fee Adjustment Factor 11 (page 21)***
	- ***Renovation to existing Buildings (versus New Construction)***
		- *Renovation work is well-known for its unknown conditions. This is the reason that it is recommended that renovations to existing buildings be performed on a time basis. If a percentage-fee is used the fee needs to be adjusted and increased to allow for the unknown work   and  the  subsequent design    modifications the  Architects will   need   to  make.    Some provincial associations recommend an adjustment of an additional two-thirds of the fee or an adjustment factor of 1.65 for renovations*

---

If one applied an adjustment factor of 1.65, as suggested above, the adjusted fee would be **13.7%** (1.65 x 8.3%) of construction costs.

 As you can see from our proposed not-to-exceed fee and hourly rates outlined above, not to mention our eagerness to work with you, we have decided to provide a more economical rate relative what the industry average suggests.  

We are confident that through our unique and open way of working and our strong band of collaborators and consultants, that that we will meet and exceed the industry standard of care.

*Reimbursable expenses include an additional 10% to cover in-house administration,	handling,	and	financing.*
